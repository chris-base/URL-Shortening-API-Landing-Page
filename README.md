## Overview

This challenge is to make a website landing page for a url shortening product that uses the shrtcode API, although I did not use this API as it was very slow. I decided to use [gotiny-api](https://github.com/robvanbakel/gotiny-api) as it was much faster and also very easy to implement. This page has all the main components that a landing page would have, including the header, body, and a footer with all information about the product.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

### What I learned

I learned a lot about local storage and keeping data even when the user is not on the webpage that could be used at a later date when the user needs it. I also learned about using functions that will be able to copy to a users clipboard for later use. This challenged helped me a lot with getting better at styling and responsiveness.
